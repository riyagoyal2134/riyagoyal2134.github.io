            <h2>Research Experience</h2>

            <h3>Undergraduate Researcher | Stockton University <i>(Feb 2022 – Present)</i></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Conducted advanced research under Professor Bradley Forrest on graph theory, focusing on the mathematical properties and universal solvability of the "Lights Out" game on nearly complete graphs.</li>
                <li>Developed and optimized algorithms simulating complex graph configurations, employing high-level linear algebra, combinatorics, and probabilistic analysis.</li>
                <li>Leading the manuscript preparation for publication in peer-reviewed journals.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Researcher | Health Analytics Research Team, Stockton University <i>(Feb 2022 – Present)</i></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed AI-driven methodologies to improve physician-patient communication, targeting Alzheimer's disease, mental health, and aging populations.</li>
                <li>Co-authored multiple peer-reviewed publications; contributed to health informatics solutions with measurable clinical and research impact.</li>
                <li>Developing a platform for the Stockton Center for Successful Aging to facilitate research and community engagement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>CASE Intern | Council for Advancement and Support of Education, Scripps College <i>(Summer 2024)</i></h3>
            <ul>
